## Log

### R1D1 (June 13,2019)
Started a basic CSS
* CSS(Cascading style sheets)
* Used to make our web projects awesome and beautiful so you can say CSS is responsible for styling
* What's really cool about CSS is the fact that just like with a HTML now we don't have to download anything to start using CSS and we can just start using CSS right away.

In general there are 3 ways how to start using CSS the 
1. inline 
2. internal  
3. external CSS.

* Hover the astronaut image for 3s, 
* So when the 1st transition of with color of box shadow end. 
* Then after 0.5s the card will move down. 
* Card will display nicely. 
* Animate multiple background each layer is set to move different distances.
* Start background the furthest layer in the back is moving slowest.
* Then the start on top of that layer is moving a little bit faster.
* The planet rolls a long it's moving faster then both of start layers.
* Cool 3D depth perception.
