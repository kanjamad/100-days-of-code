## Log

### R1D1 (June 13,2019)
Started a basic CSS
* CSS(Cascading style sheets)
* Used to make our web projects awesome and beautiful so you can say CSS is responsible for styling
* What's really cool about CSS is the fact that just like with a HTML now we don't have to download anything to start using CSS and we can just start using CSS right away.

In general there are 3 ways how to start using CSS the 
1. inline 
2. internal  
3. external CSS.
